# Portals Proto
This is a small project where I tried to implement some features from the Portal games in Unreal Engine 5 for educational purposes.  
The goal was to learn the Unreal Engine and improve my math knoweledge while having some fun.

## Features
- Portals visuals
- Portal wall
- Ability to spawn portal on specific walls
- Velocity conservation through portals
- Ability to carry objects
- Ability to pickup objects through portals
- Duplicate object when intersecting with portals

## Limitations
- Cannot carry objects through portals
- Visual glitch when teleporting from one portal to the other due to camera clipping
- Portal teleportation detection fail sometimes when jumping inside a floor portal and vertical portal (very rarely)

## Inputs
- **Left Mouse Button** to spawn a blue portal on suported surface
- **Right Mouse Button** to spawn a red portal on suported surface
- **WASD** to move
- **F** to pickup orange cubes
- **ESC** or **P** to pause the game
